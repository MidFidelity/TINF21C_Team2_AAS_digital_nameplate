|----------------|-----------------------------|
|Who will operate as a crucial interface or rather junction between the people focussing primarily on coding and documentation?               |Erika Zhang will be the crucial junction between those two groups. Everyone will know certain aspects of each code part and document, but Erika Zhang will know the details to spread some information between the subteams, whenever needed.                             |
|Who will research which topic?                |The subteams will have seperate meetings to discuss this topic. The results will be illustrated via issues in the projects-board which will be assigned to a team member.                            |
|When will the time tracking- and meeting protocol template be done?                |The templates were shown in this meeting. After everyone acknowlegded the design and ideas behind the illustrations, the templates where commited to their subfolders in the Github-repository. |
|When can a meeting take place to discuss the way we use the Github-repository?                | This meeting will take place on the 24.09. at 2pm.                             |
|Information @all: The DHBW said that everyone should work up to a maximum of 180 hours in this class.                | This information was shared with all team members.                            |
|Information @all: At the end of the third semester, this documents should be finished and submitted:<ul><li>presentation</li><li>meeting protocols</li><li>CRS, BC, SRS, SAS and the project plan</li></ul>           |This information was shared with all team members.                             |
|Information @all: Please document every task you have worked on. To do that, please use the projects-boards and do not forget to update your personal time tracking protocol.|This information was shared with all team members.|
|Information @all: Every subteam should think of their primary goal for the third semester and for the project in general.Try to make those goals as specific and precise as possible. Please inform Adrian Khairi about those goals due to the 26.09. end of business. Those informations are needed for some documents.|This information was shared with all team members.|
|information @all: on the **11.11.2022** the presentation will be given and until the **30.10.2022** all documents should be submitted.|This information was shared with all team members and it will be considered while setting the deadlines of the issues.|
|Idea: Maybe we could look up the Github-repositories of the previous classes to get some inspiration.|This idea was considered a fairly good one. Everyone will look up those Github-repositories in the next days.|
|Who will create and design the UMLs?|The team members who will primarily work on the code will have a meeting on 24.09.2022 at 10am to design the requested UMLs. Afterwards this team will inform the other members of the team about the results. This task will be done by Erika Zhang.|

## Problems

* How should we split up the task to work in the most efficient way, regarding the deadlines of the third semester?

## Agenda and Summary
<!-- please use iterating numbers-->

|Agenda          |Summary                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
|Define goals for the whole project as well as subgoals for both semesters.                |The goal for the whole project is to create a nameplate generator according to the DIN standard. As well as an UI containing a list of all the components and a search function with autocomplete. It should also be able to display all the sorted information for the asset chosen by the user. Additionally, it should contain a donwload option for PNG and SVG. The main goal is split into two subgoals for the 3rd and 4th semester. The main aspect of the third semester will therefore be to programm the functional tasks such as the requests to the AAS Server through input by the user, a simple UI with the ability to select an asset and generate QR-Code for said asset. Also to generate SVG and PNG from a test canvas. The main task of the 4th semester is to create a react front end as well as fine tuning.                             |
|Set general tools and programming language.                |To test the QR-Codes Scandit Demo and Barcode Generator can be used. The editor is Webstorm and the request art will be fetch. For the illustrations we will use <https://www.softwareideas.net/>. Programming languages will be JavaScript, CSS and HTML.                             |
|Determine modeling techniques.                |A simple activity flow chart was created. Sequence, time flow, class and distribution charts as well as UI and dialog sketches have to be made.                             |
|Create Milestones and Issues and assign them.                |The milestones and issues were created as well as assigned using Github.                             |
|Set code guidelines.                |Following Code Guidelines were set: <ul><li>Camel Case</li><li>Comments only when absolutely necessary</li><li>Methods and Variable names in lower case and understandable</li><li>Method names long (3-4 words)</li><li>Variable names as short as possible</li><li>Iteration Variables should be used in this order: i, j, k</li><li>line after declaring variables</li></ul>                            |

## Problems

At the moment, there are no problems which have to be mentioned.

# Meeting  Protocol  of  30.09.2022 <a name="SC-30.09.2022"></a>

## Type of Meeting

This meeting was a ```Team Code Meeting```.

## Protocol Writer

This protocol was written by ```Erika Zhang```.

## Meeting Participants

* Janin Ahlemeyer
* Maris Koch
* Mika Kuge
* Erika Zhang

## Meeting Duration

This meeting took ```1 hour```.

## Agenda and Summary

|Agenda          |Summary                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
|Presenting tasks results.                |The progress is:<ul><li>Maris Koch: Researched the QRCode.js library and successfully generated QR codes in PNG and SVG format for test purposes. Due to the problem mentioned below Maris Koch also generated QR codes using SVG resulting in a distinct text and QR code even when zooming in.</li><li>Mika Kuge: Demonstrated the base structure of the react project.</li><li>Janin Ahlemeyer: Presented the different Licenses Permissive, Copyleft, Weak Copyleft and Copyright. Specifically the options github already has were introduced. The team decided to use MIT and it was added to the project github under [LICENSE](https://github.com/mk28/TINF21C_Team2_AAS_digital_nameplate/blob/main/LICENSE).</li><li>Erika Zhang: Display of the UI sketches. Small changes such as smaller navigation bar, titles and adding animations were suggested by the team.</li></ul>                             |
|Adjust the tasks and assign them.                |The tasks were adjusted by adding more details for instance required function. This can be seen in the issue details of the project github. The tasks were assigned.                             |

## Problems


Maris Koch: While creating QR codes, the QR codes as well as the text are blurry when zooming in therefore using canvas is not a good option.

## Work Progress


|Name            |Task                         |

## Agenda and Summary
<!-- please use iterating numbers-->

|Agenda          |Summary                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
|Could everyone give an update on his/her work progress? *This will be documented in the upcoming section.* Furthermore, this will inform everyone about the current status of the project.                |Done, look at ```Work Progress```                             |
|Is anybody facing a problem related to the project's success? *This will be documented in the upcoming section.*                |Done, look at ```Problems```                             |
|Information @all: Do not forget to set every hour you worked for this project in your personal time tracking protocol.                | Done                            |
|Do we already have an excellent Github-wiki? If not, who could write one? What should be written in this certain section? Furthermore, please set up an issue on the projects-board and choose a deadline.                |Maris Koch will primarily write the Wiki. We can inspire ourselves by the Wiki's of previous classes. It is important to write the general background, the user manual, the dependencies, and the end-user-explanation. Further details will be talked about, when the general overview is created.                             |
|Are there any other things related to this project you want to talk about?                |The tasks and topics are more team specific things than general tasks, so they will be mentioned in subcall meetings.                             |
|Erika Zhang had a suggestion: At the moment, we use one folder for every type of meeting protocol, e.g. weeklys and subteam meetings. Should we seperate the weekly protocol from other meeting protocols by creating subfolders?                |Undertiteling the protocol's names is the way to go to differenciate the meetings types from each other.                             |
|How can we split up Janin Ahlemeyer & Erika Zhang's workloads? Both of them feel ill due to Covid. They should rest, instead of doing project related work.|Done, every task is scheduled in GitHub's project|
|BC table: Do the hours fit your roles?|It was talked about the topic and everybody is feeling ok with the table.|
|BC: Please read the document and check it on logic and grammar. -@Sophie Kirschner and Erika Zhang|Both will read the document and comment on it, whenever they see some uncertainties.|
|@Sophie Kirschner: Can you create the GANTT chart? You will find some inspiriration looking in our BC and by looking up the repositories of previos classes.|It will be done due to Monday.|
|SAS titeling should be refined - look @Mika Kuge's chat with Adrian Khairi|Done|

## Problems

* Maris Koch: the first idea was to generate the name plates via canvas. That will not work. In the subcall meeting they will focus on this topic.

* Mika Kuge: Mika Kuge also found the same problem as Maris Koch.

* Adrian Khairi and Erika Zhang: BC has to be shortened to meet the expectations of four pages.

## Work Progress


|Name            |Task                         |

in DIN und VDE" and "DIN SPEC 91406" PDF in the nextcloud? If not, is it important to our work? If yes, who could read and summarize it?                |The relevant PDFs were read by all team members of Team Code and uncertainties were discussed in a special meeting.                             |
| A wish by Sophie Kirschner: We should do a poll on some design choices: looking at her document...<ul><li>Should we use ":" in tables?</li><li>Should the version-iteration start with 0.x or 1.x? E.g. version 0.1</li><li>How should the title page look like? Adrian Khairi's version or Sophie Kirschner's?</li><li>Should the version control be on the title page?</li><li>Should the references be referenced in IEEE style or just with a link?</li></ul>                |Those details were discussed and harmonized by the team. In that case, Sophie Kirschner's wish to discuss those topics is accomplished. These are the results: <ul><li>Without ":"</li><li>It should iterate starting from 1.0</li><li>Adrian Khairi & Erika Zhang's design will be the style of the title page</li><li>no, it should not</li><li>They should be referenced in IEEE</li></ul>                             |
|@Erika Zhang und Adrian Khairi: Write weekly update to customers.|Done|
