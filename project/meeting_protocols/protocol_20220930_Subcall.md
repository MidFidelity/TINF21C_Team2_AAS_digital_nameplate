## Summary
<!-- please use iterating numbers-->

1. 
* Maris: Researched the QRCode.js library and successfully generated QR codes in PNG and SVG format for test purposes. Due to the problem mentioned below Maris also generated QR codes using SVG resulting in a distinct text and QR code even when zooming in.

* Mika: Demonstrated the base structure of the react project.

* Janin: Presented the different Licenses Permissive, Copyleft, Weak Copyleft and Copyright. Specifically the options github already has were introduced. The team decided to use MIT and it was added to the project github under [LICENSE](https://github.com/mk28/TINF21C_Team2_AAS_digital_nameplate/blob/main/LICENSE).

* Erika: Display of the UI sketches. Small changes such as smaller navigation bar, titles and adding animations were suggested by the team.

2. The tasks were adjusted by adding more details for instance required function. This can be seen in the issue details of the project github. The tasks were assigned.

## Problems
<!-- fill out if something happened, otherwise just let the preview sentence stay there-->

Maris: While creating QR codes, the QR codes as well as the text are blurry when zooming in therefore using canvas is not a good option.
