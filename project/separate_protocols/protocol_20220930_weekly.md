## Agenda
<!-- please use iterating numbers-->

1. Could everyone give an update on his/her work progress? *This will be documented in the upcoming section.* Furthermore, this will inform everyone about the current status of the project.

2. Is anybody facing a problem related to the project's success? *This will be documented in the upcoming section.*

3. Information @all: Do not forget to set every hour you worked for this project in your personal time tracking protocol.
  
4. Do we already have an excellent Github-wiki? If not, who could write one? What should be written in this certain section? Furthermore, please set up an issue on the projects-board and choose a deadline.

5. Are there any other things related to this project you want to talk about?

6. Erika had a suggestion: At the moment, we use one folder for every type of meeting protocol, e.g. weeklys and subteam meetings. Should we seperate the weekly protocol from other meeting protocols by creating subfolders?

7. How can we split up Janin & Erika's workloads? Both of them feel ill due to Covid. They should rest, instead of doing project related work.

8. BC table: Do the hours fit your roles?

9. BC: Please read the document and check it on logic and grammar. -@Sophie and Erika

10. @Sophie: Can you create the GANTT chart? You will find some inspiriration looking in our BC and by looking up the repositories of previos classes.

11. SAS titeling should be refined - look @Mika's chat with Adrian

## Summary
<!-- please use iterating numbers-->

1. Done, look at ```Work Progress```

2. Done, look at ```Problems```

3. Done

4. Maris will primarily write the Wiki. We can inspire ourselves by the Wiki's of previous classes. It is important to write the general background, the user manual, the dependencies, and the end-user-explanation. Further details will be talked about, when the general overview is created.

5. The tasks and topics are more team specific things than general tasks, so they will be mentioned in subcall meetings.

6. Undertiteling the protocol's names is the way to go to differenciate the meetings types from each other.

7. Done, every task is scheduled in GitHub's project

8. It was talked about the topic and everybody is feeling ok with the table.

9. Both will read the document and comment on it, whenever they see some uncertainties.

10. It will be done due to Monday.

11. Done

## Problems
<!-- fill out if something happened, otherwise just let the previewn sentence stay there-->

* Maris: the first idea was to generate the name plates via canvas. That will not work. In the subcall meeting they will focus on this topic.

* Mika: Mika also found the same problem as Maris.

* Adrian and Erika: BC has to be shortened to meet the expectations of 4 pages.
