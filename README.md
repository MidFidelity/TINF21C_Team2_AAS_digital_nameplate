# TINF21C_Team2_AAS_digital_nameplate

The Digital Nameplate Generator is a project created in the scope of the course "Software Engineering" at Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Stuttgart. The Goal of this project is to create a nameplate generator for an Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The application can be found under following link, [Digital Nameplate Generator](https://mk28.github.io/TINF21C_Team2_AAS_digital_nameplate/#/home). 

A Server for testing the application can be found at [https://ccae4836-001e-48c2-a4f9-235554f9400b.ma.bw-cloud-instance.org/](https://ccae4836-001e-48c2-a4f9-235554f9400b.ma.bw-cloud-instance.org/)

## Goals
The main objective of this project is to create a nameplate generator for an Asset Administration Shell, also known as "AAS". The application shall be able to create graphical illustrations based on the properties provided by the AAS as well as the ability to generate QR codes according to the DIN standard.  
Furthermore, a user-friendly front-end application, set up on the host system, shall be designed and implemented utilizing React. This includes a home page where the user can enter a server address. After selecting the server, the user shall be directed to a user interface (UI) listing all the components available on the server. Additionally, the interface shall display the data regarding the asset chosen by the user in an organized and clear structure. The interface allows the communication between any AAS server through REST-API. Additionally, there shall be an option to download the nameplate in SVG or PNG format. The application shall be tested to ensure compatibility with a diverse AAS server infrastructure. Forbye, the project shall provide a [User Manual](https://github.com/mk28/TINF21C_Team2_AAS_digital_nameplate/wiki/User-Manual) documentation online.
